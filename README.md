<h4>CS50 Final Project by Senat Selimoski</h4>
<hr>
<br>

<h1>Project name: short50.ly</h1>


<p>This is a URL shortener platform somewhat like bitly, it is entirely made in python 
using python's microframework Flask.</p>

<ul><h3>This project has the following of features:</h3>
<li>It has custom auth service where users can sign up and login onto our platform
</li>
<li>Registered users can make their regular long URL paths into a short links that can share with others.
For instance links like https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/flying-with-your-cat, can easily become somewhat like
<strong>short50.ly/abcxyz/</strong>
</li>
<li>And another,and my favorite one feature of this application is adding branded shortcodes which will help product marketing 
and make links more shareable on the social media, example links like https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/travel-safely-your-pet-car-airplane-ship-or-train
<strong>humansociety.org/travelpets</strong>
</li>
<li>And last but not least, as a future update of this app i plan to widen it to some kind of analitycs where users can track their clicks,
and later with introducing some geo apis to get wider picture for as where their clicks comming from which will help users so they 
can make custom marketing campains, and make better products decisions based on those analitycs tools.
</li>
</ul>

<p>This project i also want to get it online on some platform like heroku or aws.
I would be glad to hear your suggestions, and even more happy if you willing to contribute on this project.
